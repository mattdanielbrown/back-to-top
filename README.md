Back-To-Top Button
==================

See It In Action
----------------

[Demo Here](https://matthewdanielbrown.com/dev/demo/back-to-top)

HTML/jQuery Module That Adds A Persistent Sticky Button To The Bottom Corner Of The Window And Allows The User To Auto-Scroll Back Up To The Top Of The Page.

When the page is loaded, the button is initially hidden. Once scrolling has progressed far enough (roughly 25% of the window height, away from the top of the page), the button fades in.

Upon returning to, or passing that point, the button smoothly fades out, ensuring that the button is only present when it's needed.

The module is also responsive: The button's size and position adjust according to the screen/window size.
